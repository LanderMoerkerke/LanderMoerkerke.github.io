## Setup and usage
### Requirements
- [Node JS](http://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) - Optional
### Install
Navigate to the project root directory using your terminal. Now, to install all the required packages run this command.
If you installed Yarn alongside Node JS you can replace 'npm' with 'yarn', you will get the same result.
```node
npm install
```
### Use
Gulp is a javascript task runner that lets you automate tasks such as bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets.
To run gulp, you run this piece of code in the same directory as just:
```node
gulp
```
